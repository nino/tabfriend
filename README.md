## Installation instructions

Until I get around to packing this extension into a nice package,
you'll have to install it manually.
Fortunately, this is not _too_ difficult:

- Download a copy of this repo
- Go to <chrome://extensions> (or, presumably, its equivalent in Firefox).
- Click on “Developer mode” in the top-right of the screen.
- Click on “Load unpacked”
  (this button should have appeared after the previous step).
- Select the repo folder on your hard drive.

That will install the extension,
and it should work at least for a few months,
until it suddenly, mysteriously, disappears.
